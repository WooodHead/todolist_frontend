# todolist_frontend
The web frontend to [todolist](http://todolist.site).  It is based off of [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate), which provides a lot of nice things if you're doing react development.

## To run locally:

1.  `npm install --save`
2.  `npm start`

If you don't want to use a live backend, switch to using a `LocalBackend` in `TodoStore`.  At some point this will probably be controlled by url params, but for now you need to modify it yourself.
